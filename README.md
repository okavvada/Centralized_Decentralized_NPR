## Background
Water reuse involves treating wastewater to an appropriate standard so it can be used again in other applications rather than being discharged into an ocean, river or other water body. Water reuse has been expanding rapidly, especially in drought-prone locations such as California. Adopters view reuse as an opportunity to enhance and diversify their water portfolio by supplementing other water sources with recycled water. Water reuse can be an efficient way to provide reliable, safe, drought-resilient, local water.

The core and integral criterion for sustainable water reuse implantation is the issue of system scale. Managing water is often an energy-intensive activity. Recycled water needs to be collected, treated and re-distributed to customers, processes that all require material and energy inputs and emit greenhouse gases (GHG) at the site of implementation and throughout the life-cycle. The current water infrastructure is based in large centralized infrastructure, that in most cases requires significant conveyance requirements as the wastewater treatment plants are located downhill and away from the cities. The system has been designed this way to take advantage of the strong "economies of scale" tha occur in large treatment plants. This conventional system however, does not promote reuse as the source and demand are highly disconnected. This tradeoff is generally understood but has been poorly analyzed because it depends on many site-specific factors: land use, water demands, population density, and topography to name a few. 

This project combines spatial analysis and a LCA methodology to develop an algorithm for the estimation of the environmental impacts of decentralized versus centralized non-potable water reuse. Two separate models are developed, one to assess a decentralized reuse scenario in multiple scales and one for the centralized reuse alternative taking into account the existing infrastructure. The models are currently developed for the city of San Francisco.
